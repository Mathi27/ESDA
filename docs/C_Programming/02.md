# History of C Programming

## Origins
- **1969-1973**: Developed by **Dennis Ritchie** at **Bell Labs** (AT&T) as a successor to the **B language**.
- Purpose: To create a language for writing the **UNIX operating system**.
- Influenced by **BCPL** (Basic Combined Programming Language) and **B language**.

## Key Milestones
- **1972**: C language was born, named as a successor to B.
- **1978**: Publication of **"The C Programming Language"** by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (often referred to as **K&R C**).
- **1989**: Standardized by ANSI as **ANSI C** (C89).
- **1990**: Adopted by ISO as **ISO C** (C90).
- **1999**: **C99** standard introduced new features like `//` comments, `inline` functions, and variable-length arrays.
- **2011**: **C11** standard added support for multi-threading, atomic operations, and more.
- **2018**: **C18** (C17) standard, a minor update to fix defects in C11.

## Impact
- Foundation for many modern languages like **C++**, **Java**, **C#**, and **Python**.
- Widely used in system programming, embedded systems, and operating systems (e.g., Linux, Windows).
- Remains one of the most popular and influential programming languages.

## Key Features
- **Procedural language**: Focuses on functions and structured programming.
- **Low-level access**: Allows direct memory manipulation via pointers.
- **Portability**: Can run on various hardware platforms with minimal changes.
