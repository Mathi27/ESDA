# Characteristics of C

 **Structured Programming Language**:
   - Allows modular design with functions and loops for organized code.

**Low-Level Access**:
   - Provides access to hardware-level features via pointers and direct memory manipulation.

 **Rich Library Support**:
   - Offers a variety of built-in functions for tasks like math, I/O, and string handling.

 **Portable**:
   - Code written in C is highly portable across different hardware and operating systems.

 **Efficient and Fast**:
   - Due to its low-level nature, C programs run quickly with minimal overhead.

**Powerful Operators**:
   - Includes a wide range of operators like arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise.

**Extensibility**:
   - Users can add custom libraries or functions to extend its capabilities.

**Procedural Language**:
   - Follows a procedural approach, emphasizing sequence, selection, and iteration.

**Memory Management**:
   - Provides dynamic memory allocation using `malloc()`, `calloc()`, and `free()`.
